#Coffee Shop Intranet!!


Project Description:
	
The purpose of this project is to create a program that would isolate a small internet connection in a room of a specific place such as a coffee shop. The connection will start through a private server and it will show up to the network as a Wi-Fi connection. As the user connects his mobile device or his/her computer on the server with a password, it would be in this connection that the customer would be able to access information at this specific place.
  
The connection will have specific websites that is exclusive for that intranet. It would have a chat room that will only be available for the users that are connected to the network. The server will also have a local search engine that would able the user to search and find information on this Intranet. There would also be an option for the customer to able to create their own blog.
